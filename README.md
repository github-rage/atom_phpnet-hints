# phpnet-hints
Autocomplete hints for Atom based on live search results from php.net

While editing a .php file, terminating any word with a bracket starts a query on php.net. The results (first 10 by default) then are loaded into an autocomplete dropdown with hints about parameters and usage and a link to the manual page.

Fetching the results may take a few seconds depending on your internet connection.
